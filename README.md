# NGO-WEBSITE
We were able to get suitably used to the end-to-end web designing processâ€”ideation and requirement gathering, up to deployment and user testing. We were able to develop a completely completed, working website that captures the entire NGO "Grace & Grit Foundation" and achieves its simplest goal of creating awareness, public interest, and open communication channel with possible donors and volunteers.
The site utilizes the latest technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for smooth backend operations and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsiveness and frontend cleanliness. Integration of AI-based chatbots introduces yet another facet of innovation with instant responses to recurring questions by users. The site is value-aligned not only to the NGO but also utilizes access and usability on a device.
This project has improved our technical skills, problem-solving, and teamwork considerably. The knowledge and experience so far in this project will surely be helpful to us in our future academic and professional careers.
